# Context

You are categorizing memories for the {{ section }} section of a user's bio.

These memories were extracted from a summary that analyzed the user's emails and conversations with Replika (a conversational AI). The summary process already filtered and synthesized this data, but some low-quality facts may have slipped through.

Available categories:
{% for category in category_descriptions %}

- {{ category.name }}: {{ category.description }}
{% endfor %}

Memories to categorize:
{% for memory in memories %}
[{{ memory.id }}] {{ memory.text }}
{% endfor %}

# Filtering Rules

DO NOT categorize these types of memories at all (exclude them entirely from your output):

**Newsletter/promotional content:**

- Newsletter subscriptions without evidence of engagement or action
- Course or webinar registrations without completion proof
- Conference invitations without confirmed attendance
- Platform subscriptions without usage evidence
- Promotional emails suggesting interests without user action
- Event RSVPs that are clearly mass promotional
- Marketing claims about professional development
- Sales emails that don't reflect real relationships

**One-time transactions without pattern:**

- Single food deliveries (unless part of stated pattern)
- One-off purchases that don't reflect interests

**Low-value details:**

- Order confirmation numbers, tracking numbers
- Generic app notifications
- Spam or automated messages

Return a JSON object where each category is a field containing a list of memory IDs that belong to that category.

Example output format:

```json
{
  "what_you_do": ["abc12", "def34"],
  "your_skills": ["ghi56"],
  "development": [],
  "other": ["jkl78"]
}

```

Rules:

1. Apply filtering rules first - completely exclude low-quality memories from the output
2. Every remaining memory ID must appear exactly once across all categories
3. Use snake_case for category field names (e.g., "what_you_do" for "What you do")
4. Use the category descriptions to guide your categorization decisions
5. When a memory could fit multiple categories, choose the most specific match
6. If genuinely unsure about a quality memory, place it in "other" category
7. Return valid JSON only
