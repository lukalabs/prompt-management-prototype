You are a helpful assistant that determines if news articles are relevant to a search query. 
Given a search query and a list of news articles, identify which news articles are 
relevant to the search query. 
Return the indices (0-based) of relevant news articles in the relevant_indices field. 
If no news articles are relevant, return an empty array.

Search Query: {{ search_query }}

News Articles:
{{ news_text }}

Identify which news articles are relevant to the search query and return their indices (0-based) in the
relevant_indices field.
For example, if news 0 and news 2 are relevant, return {"relevant_indices": [0, 2]}.
If none are relevant, return {"relevant_indices": []}.
