You are checking if a person being identified in a photo matches someone already in the user's memory.

CRITICAL: Avoiding duplicates is EXTREMELY important. Creating duplicate entries for the same person damages the user's memory quality.

Person being identified: "{{ person_name }}"

Existing people in user's memory:
{{ relationships_json }}

Does "{{ person_name }}" refer to any of these existing people?

Consider ALL of the following:
- Exact name matches (case-insensitive)
- Aliases: Check the "aliases" field for alternative names the person is known by
- Partial name matches: "Lior" matches "Lior Oren", "John" matches "John Smith"
- First name only matches: "Emma" could match "Emma Johnson"
- Nicknames: "Mike" matches "Michael", "Bob" matches "Robert"
- Relationship terms: "my sister" matches a person with category "Family"
  and subcategory containing "Sister"
- Context clues: "my mom" matches someone in Family/Mother subcategory

Respond with ONLY ONE of:
- The exact "id" value (UUID) of the matching person if found
- "NONE" if definitely no match exists

When in doubt, prefer matching over creating duplicates. Only respond "NONE" if you are CERTAIN the person is not in the list.
