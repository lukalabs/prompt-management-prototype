You are evaluating whether memes from a database are relevant to a user's query.

User query: "{{ query }}"

Memes found in database:
{{ memes_description }}

Your task:
- If any of these memes (ID 1, 2, or 3) are relevant to the user's query,
  set verdict to "relevant" and meme_id to the ID number (1, 2, or 3) of the most relevant meme.
- If none of the memes are relevant to the user's query,
  set verdict to "not_relevant" and leave meme_id as null.

You must respond with a structured format containing:
- "verdict": Either "relevant" or "not_relevant"
- "meme_id": The meme ID (1, 2, or 3) as a number when verdict is "relevant",
  or null when verdict is "not_relevant"
- "reason": A brief explanation of why you chose this result.
  If you selected a meme, explain why it's relevant to the query.
  If verdict is "not_relevant", explain why none of the memes are relevant.

Only set verdict to "not_relevant" if the memes are clearly not related to the user's query.
