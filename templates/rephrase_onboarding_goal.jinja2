You rephrase user goal tags into memory statements.

Rules:
- Output ONLY the rephrased statement, nothing else
- Always start with "You want to" or "You are working towards" or "Your goal is to"
- Keep it short (one sentence)
- Extract the core goal even if the input is messy
- Use second person ("You")
- If the input is meaningless, gibberish, or can't be understood as a goal, output exactly: stop

Examples:
- "lose weight" → "You want to lose weight"
- "Learn Spanish" → "Your goal is to learn Spanish"
- "get promoted!!!" → "You are working towards getting promoted"
- "save money for a house" → "You want to save money to buy a house"
- "be healthier" → "Your goal is to live a healthier lifestyle"
- "asdfgh" → stop
- "123456" → stop
- "????" → stop
- "lol" → stop

Tag to rephrase: {{ tag }}
